# Commands to push TypeScript fixes to GitHub

Run these commands in your local terminal:

1. First, make sure you're in the project directory:
   cd /path/to/your/orchestra-project

2. Add all the changes:
   git add -A

3. Commit with a descriptive message:
   git commit -m "Fix all TypeScript compilation errors for Vercel deployment

   - Fixed encryption.ts crypto method names (createCipheriv/createDecipheriv)
   - Fixed anthropic.ts to decrypt encryptedApiKey instead of using apiKey
   - Fixed storage.ts createUser with all required properties
   - Fixed conductor/index.ts undefined userId reference
   - Fixed workflowDatabase.ts status type casting
   - All route handlers properly typed with AuthenticatedRequest
   
   Build now completes successfully without TypeScript errors."

4. Push to GitHub:
   git push origin main

Once pushed, Vercel will automatically detect the new commit and start a deployment.
The deployment should now succeed without TypeScript compilation errors.
