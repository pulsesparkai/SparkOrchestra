# TypeScript Fixes for Vercel Deployment

## Summary of Changes

All TypeScript compilation errors have been fixed. The build now completes successfully.

### 1. Fixed encryption.ts (crypto methods)
- Changed `crypto.createCipherGCM` to `crypto.createCipheriv` (line 10)
- Changed `crypto.createDecipherGCM` to `crypto.createDecipheriv` (line 36)

### 2. Fixed anthropic.ts (API key handling)
- Added import for `EncryptionService`
- Replaced all `agent.apiKey` references with proper decryption logic:
  - Decrypt `agent.encryptedApiKey` if it exists
  - Fall back to `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - Use the decrypted key in Anthropic client initialization

### 3. Fixed storage.ts (createUser method)
- Added missing properties when creating a user:
  - `email: insertUser.email || null`
  - `createdAt: new Date()`
  - `stripeCustomerId: null`
  - `stripeSubscriptionId: null`
  - `userPlan: insertUser.userPlan || "free"`

### 4. Fixed conductor/index.ts (undefined userId)
- Added `const userId = agent.userId;` before using it in tokenTracker call (line 244)

### 5. Fixed workflowDatabase.ts (status type casting)
- Cast the status field when returning from database:
  - Added type casting: `status: log.status as "completed" | "failed" | "started" | "skipped"`
  - Applied to both `getExecutionLogs` and `getWorkflowExecutions` methods

### 6. Fixed routes/agents.ts
- All route handlers already properly use `AuthenticatedRequest` type through type casting

## Build Result
The application now builds successfully without any TypeScript errors.

## Next Steps
1. Push these changes to GitHub
2. Vercel should automatically detect the new commit and start a deployment
3. The deployment should now succeed without TypeScript compilation errors
